# RNPA CLI Installation Guide

## Introduction
React Native Paper Abstracted is a package that allows you to use only the components you need from [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com).
Thus allowing users to keep their app size small, and provides endless customization.

## Installation

### CLI
The command-line interface tool is allows you to setup and install components effortlessly.

```bash
npm install @react-native-paper-abstracted/cli
```
<br />

### Manual
React Native Paper Abstracted can be used without installating any tools.

```bash
npm i @callstack/react-theme-provider
npm i color
npm install react-native-safe-area-context
```
Navigate to the explorer tab, and add the components in the following folders/files to your project.
1. **/core**
2. **/styles**
3. **/utils**
4. **/types.tsx**

On IOS, you need to link the native part of the React Native Paper.

```bash
npx pod-install
```

For non expo managed projects you need to install and link [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
specifically MaterialCommunityIcons.

```bash
npm install @react-native-vector-icons/material-icons
npm i @types/react-native-vector-icons
```

If you use Expo, you don't need to install vector icons. But if you have a babel.config.js or .babelrc file, make sure that it includes
babel-preset-expo.

.babelrc
```ts
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
};
```

babel.config.js
```ts
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
  };
};
```
<br />
